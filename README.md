## TF-Image-Classifier 

This is a simple Image-Classifier model using Tensorflow.The fact that computers can see is just not that amazing anymore. But, the techniques for teaching a computer to do this are now simpler and more refined than ever.

The approach here uses Keras, which is emerging as the best library for building neural networks. The code here also assumes you are using Tensorflow as the underlying library (it wonâ€™t run properly if you are using Theano). This is ready to go for binary classifications. 

For Non-Binary Classifications:

- add other classes to training and validation directories
- change class_mode from "binary" to "categorical"
- change loss function from "binary" to "categorical"

### To run the code you need to:  
- Get a keras docker container running or install tensorflow/keras on your machine
- Download the data  
- Go through the notebook
